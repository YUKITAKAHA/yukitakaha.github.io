Hi! I am Yuki takaha, a PhD student at [Graduate School of Arts and Sciences,\\
The University of Tokyo](https://www.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eng_site/) supervised by Prof. Atushi Ikeda([group website](https://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ikeda-group/index.html)).

I am interested in physics of softmatter, where nonequilibrium phenomena, statistical physics and continuum mechanics meet.\\
My current research topic is about avalanche dynamics in glassy systems.
